## üéØ What Can the AI Do?

### 1. Smart Project Creation
**You say:** "Create a marketing project for Q1 2024"

**AI does:** Creates a complete project with:
- Project name
- Description
- Type and category
- Priority level

### 2. Intelligent Task Suggestions
**You say:** "Suggest tasks for my mobile app project"

**AI does:** Generates:
- Multiple milestones
- Tasks for each milestone
- Logical project breakdown

### 3. Information Retrieval
**Available commands:**
- "What are my pending tasks?"
- "Show me overdue deadlines"
- "What projects am I working on?"
- "Help me prioritize my tasks"

### 4. General Help
Ask anything about project management:
- "How do I improve productivity?"
- "Best practices for remote teams"
- "Help me create a timeline"

## üîç Verify Everything is Working

### Test 1: Check Backend Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/ai/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "operational",
    "aiConfigured": true,
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Test 2: Test Project Creation
Open the chatbot and type:
```
Create a website project
```

You should see a detailed project suggestion with name, description, type, category, and priority.

### Test 3: Test Task Suggestions
Type in the chatbot:
```
Suggest milestones for a marketing campaign
```

You should see multiple milestones with tasks for each.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Gemini API key is not configured"
**Solution:**
1. Check that `.env` file exists in `server/` folder
2. Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key` is present
3. Make sure there are no spaces around the `=`
4. Restart the backend server

### Problem: "Cannot connect to AI service"
**Solution:**
1. Check backend is running on port 5000
2. Look for "Server running on port 5000" message
3. Verify no errors in the terminal

### Problem: Chatbot button doesn't appear
**Solution:**
1. Check frontend is running on port 3000
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Problem: "Request timeout"
**Solution:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify Gemini API is accessible
3. Check if you've exceeded daily quota (1,500 requests/day)

### Problem: Backend won't start
**Solution:**
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

If still failing, check:
- MongoDB is running
- All environment variables are set
- No other service is using port 5000

## üé® Customization Tips

```typescript
generationConfig: {
  temperature: 0.7,  // Lower = more consistent, Higher = more creative
  topK: 40,
  topP: 0.95,
}
```

### Add Custom Project Fields
Edit the JSON schema in `generateProjectFromNaturalLanguage`:
```typescript
JSON Schema:
{
    "projectName": "string",
    "projectDescription": "string",
    "projectType": "string",
    "projectCategory": "string",
    "priorityLevel": "string",
    "budget": "string",           // Add custom fields
    "estimatedDuration": "string"
}
```

### Modify Welcome Message
Edit `client/src/components/AIChatbot.tsx`:
```typescript
const welcomeMessage: Message = {
  id: '1',
  type: 'ai',
  content: `Your custom welcome message here!`,
  timestamp: new Date(),
  suggestions: [
    'Your custom suggestion 1',
    'Your custom suggestion 2'
  ]
};
```
