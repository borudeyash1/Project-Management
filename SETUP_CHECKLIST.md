## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "GEMINI_API_KEY is not configured"

**Solution:**
- [ ] Double-check `.env` file has `GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key`
- [ ] Verify no spaces around the `=` sign
- [ ] Ensure API key is the actual key, not placeholder text
- [ ] Restart backend server (Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev`)

### Problem: "Cannot connect to AI service"

**Solution:**
- [ ] Check backend terminal - should show "Server running on port 5000"
- [ ] Check for errors in backend terminal
- [ ] Verify `FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000` in `.env`
- [ ] Check CORS errors in browser console (F12)

### Problem: "Request timeout"

**Solution:**
- [ ] Check your internet connection
- [ ] Verify you can access https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com
- [ ] Check if you've exceeded daily quota (1,500 requests)
- [ ] Try again in a few minutes

### Problem: Backend won't start

**Solution:**
- [ ] Check MongoDB is running
- [ ] Verify `MONGODB_URI` in `.env` is correct
- [ ] Run `npm install` in server directory
- [ ] Check port 5000 is not in use by another app
- [ ] Review terminal error messages

### Problem: Chatbot button doesn't appear

**Solution:**
- [ ] Check frontend is running on port 3000
- [ ] Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- [ ] Open browser console (F12) and check for errors
- [ ] Try refreshing the page
- [ ] Try different browser

### Problem: AI gives weird/unexpected responses

**Solution:**
- [ ] This is normal occasionally - AI is probabilistic
- [ ] Try rephrasing your question
- [ ] Be more specific in your request
- [ ] Check backend logs for API errors
